# Bike Sales Data Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and resources for my data analysis project, focusing on the Bike Sales dataset. The project involved utilizing Power BI to ensure data integrity and create interactive visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of the sales data.

## Dataset
The project is centered around the Bike Sales dataset, which provides detailed information on [describe the specific details of the dataset, such as the source, attributes, and its relevance to the bike sales industry].

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following key sections:

1. **Data Integrity Check in Power BI**: A comprehensive data integrity check was performed using Power BI to validate the consistency and accuracy of the dataset. The integrity check ensured that the data was reliable and suitable for analysis and visualization.

2. **Interactive Dashboard Creation**: An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize key insights and trends within the Bike Sales dataset. The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
   - Revenue by City (Map)
   - Revenue by Product (Clustered Column Chart)
   - Quantity Sold by Category (Pie Chart)
   - Revenue by Category (Stacked Column Chart)

## Visualizations and Analysis
The interactive dashboard enabled the following insights and analysis:
- **Revenue by City (Map):** Geospatial representation of revenue distribution across different cities, highlighting regional sales performance and potential market opportunities.
- **Revenue by Product (Clustered Column Chart):** Comparative analysis of revenue generated by different bike products, allowing for a quick understanding of the top-performing products.
- **Quantity Sold by Category (Pie Chart):** Illustration of the proportion of bike sales across different categories, aiding in the identification of popular product categories.
- **Revenue by Category (Stacked Column Chart):** Analysis of revenue distribution across various product categories, emphasizing the contribution of each category to the overall sales revenue.

## Data Analyst Skills Utilized
The project demonstrates the following key data analyst skills:
- **Data Integrity Check:** Ensured data reliability through comprehensive integrity checks, contributing to the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Created interactive visualizations to communicate complex insights effectively, enhancing the understanding of the sales data.
- **Data Interpretation:** Analyzed and interpreted data trends and patterns to derive actionable insights for the bike sales industry.
- **Creativity:** Implemented creative approaches to visualize data and present complex information in an easily understandable format, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Requirements
- Power BI Desktop (latest version)

## Future Scope
The project sets the foundation for potential future enhancements, such as [mention potential areas for additional visualizations, advanced analytics, or integration with other data sources] to further enrich the analysis and gain deeper insights into the bike sales industry.
